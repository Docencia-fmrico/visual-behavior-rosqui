# VISUAL BEHAVIOUR   
We were asked to complete the following task which, in this case we were obliged to use **behaviour trees**, a different way of approaching the solution of these exercises instead of using finite state machine.

This task is called visual navigation as we have had to handle 3 exercises:

## FOLLOW PERSON
First of all we have done a behaviour tree called **follow person**. As you can see, by its name we can know that the task it performs is following a person. 
We used darknet ros filtered just only for people

(See alvaro’s PDF and add  all aplications used “Darknet Ros and all packages you need to download)

<details><summary><b>Darknet Ros Modificated</b></summary>
(We edited all yamls and we only included “person” in detection clases names) *add snippet*
