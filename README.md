<p align="center"> We were asked to complete the following task which, in this case we were obliged to use <b>behaviour trees</b>, a different way of approaching the solution of these exercises instead of using finite state machine.
 </p>

This task is called visual navigation as we have had to handle 3 exercises:

## FOLLOW PERSON
First of all we have done a behaviour tree called **follow person**. As you can see, by its name we can know that the task it performs is following a person. 
We used darknet ros filtered just only for people.
